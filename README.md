# 📖 About Project

This application is the secont challenge from the [Ignite Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/ignite).

The main objective of the challenge is to refactor a page for listing movies according to genre.

The application was already fully functional but much of its code was directly in the `App.tsx` file. It was necessary to divide the application into two main parts: sidebar and the main content that has the header and the movie listing.

- The application has only one main feature, which is the movie listing;
- In the sidebar it is possible to select which category of movies should be listed;
- The first category in the list (which is "Action") should already start as marked;
- The application's header has only the name of the selected category that must dynamically change.
